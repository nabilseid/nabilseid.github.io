*22/10/2021 - in Seychelles anxiously waiting for the plane at the gates*


<p>
The family of four we got at the airport at Seychelles that missed their flight like us. They got two daughters, roughly age 10 & 13. The way they dress looks fine for a flight to me. Both of them have pink beats headphones wrapping around their necks. They seem confident, you know they are from financially successful family and they brought them to Seychelles, what is there to be more confident about. But the way they manifest their confidence looks more artificial and dependent on the wealth they think their family has. Anything they want their family will provide. They are above their peers. Nothing is stopping them from being confident. It feels more like outward confidence. It is heavily dependent on the stuff they put on themselves and the wealthy their family can show to other people (or peers). They are confident because their attention(people / peers) will see good things on them. Their personality seems to me it can shatter if someone else with bigger wealthy comes in the picture, they lose the wealthy( of course, anybody will be affect by this, degree differs tho) or the people / peers around them loose interest in what they can show off.

On the other side while I was waiting for the on-boarding, I saw some french people I think with 3 kids - son, daughter, son - roughly 14, 8, 6 ages. Before the family came to on board, the elder son comes to the front inform the ticket checker that they are coming. And they way he do it is not bad for a kid his age. Then the family came and have their thickets checked and on board. before they on board the family direct all kids to say bye to the ticket checker and they left. Since the kids are relatively younger it is hard to make comparison but here we go. The kids look confident and independent. The confidence is not from outside-in tho. It is more like inside out. I could feel it. You get their confidence on how they speak, approach people, act, look their surrounding and react to their surrounding. It doesn't feel like their confidence piller on something that could easily wipeable, the foundation is so strong you need to break them apart to shatter their confidence.

This is the kind of confidence we need our children to build. The more stronger the foundation, the harder it is to shatter it. The better the material used to build the foundation, the harder it is to shatter. We need to know what material to use to build the foundation of our kids. Read read read to the dying of the hound.
