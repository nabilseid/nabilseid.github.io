    This is my personal note of [Modern Big Data Analysis with SQL Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloudera-big-data-analysis-sql). This is only intended as a personal reference.


## Fundamentals of Data

Data is a representation of something that capture some features and ignore others. What this means is that there is a selective representation based on a context, purpose, complexity, managabiluty, etc... 

- Analog Data: a continuous representation of something. It has infinite values. At any given instance or point, it has a unique continuous value.
- Digital Data: a discrete representation of something. It has finite values. It is a sample representation of analog data.

For instance, a mechanical clock has a unique value at any given instance but a digital clock has a finite values that represent a section of time duration like 1 sec to 2 sec but analog clock has infinite values between 1 sec and 2 sec.

Data is store unorganized in a data store. In order to make sense of the data and easily retrieved, data is organized. Databases are used to store organized data.
